# Benchmark of NestJS

## 1. Introduction
- **Objective**: Evaluate whether **NestJS** is suitable for the development of your application.
- **Context**:
  - Type of application: RESTful API, web application backend, microservices, etc.
  - Specific requirements: performance, scalability, ease of use, integration, etc.


## 2. Advantages of NestJS

### a. Structure and Architecture
- **Modular Approach**:
  - NestJS follows a modular architecture inspired by Angular, which promotes clear and scalable code organization.
  - Each feature is isolated in a module, making it easier to maintain and scale.

- **Native Microservices Support**:
  - Built-in support for microservices through adapters for Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis, and more.

### b. Performance
- **Based on Node.js and TypeScript**:
  - Built on **Express** (default) or **Fastify** (optional), making it both fast and efficient.
  - Effective use of asynchronous mechanisms (`async/await` and Event Loop).

- **For your application**:
  - Ideal for applications requiring efficient handling of simultaneous connections and asynchronous operations.

### c. Native TypeScript
- NestJS is designed for TypeScript, offering:
  - Strict type management.
  - Auto-generated documentation and secure development through autocompletion and type checks.

### d. Tools and Ecosystem
- **Powerful Integrations**:
  - Native support for GraphQL, WebSockets, databases (via TypeORM, Prisma, Sequelize), and more.

- **Rich CLI**:
  - The NestJS CLI simplifies generating modules, controllers, services, and more, reducing human errors.

- **Interactive Documentation**:
  - Easy integration with Swagger for generating interactive documentation.

### e. Community and Adoption
- **Rapid Growth**:
  - NestJS has an active community and extensive documentation.
- **Adoption**:
  - Used by many large companies for modern projects.


## 3. Disadvantages of NestJS

### a. Learning Curve
- **Initial Complexity**:
  - The modular structure can be intimidating for developers accustomed to simpler frameworks like Express.
  - Proficiency in TypeScript is necessary to fully leverage the framework.

### b. Performance Limited by Node.js
- **Single-threaded**:
  - Node.js is constrained by its single-threaded architecture, which can be a bottleneck for heavy computational tasks.
  - While fast, frameworks like Go or Rust outperform NestJS in cases requiring raw performance.

### c. Dependency on Abstractions
- **High Abstraction**:
  - NestJS’s abstractions (e.g., for microservices or databases) may reduce granular control and add unnecessary complexity for small projects.

### d. Framework Overhead
- Compared to Express or Fastify, NestJS introduces overhead due to its many built-in features, which may not be necessary for simple projects.


## 4. When to Choose or Avoid NestJS?

### When NestJS is Ideal:
- **Modular Architecture**: If your project is complex and needs clear organization.
- **Microservices**: Perfect for building microservices with built-in tools.
- **Native TypeScript**: If you want to use TypeScript with maximum features.
- **Asynchronous Applications**: Ideal for APIs requiring numerous simultaneous connections.

### When NestJS is Not Ideal:
- **Simple Projects**: If the project doesn’t need all the modularity and advanced features.
- **Intensive Computation**: If the application needs to handle heavy server-side tasks, a more performant language like Go or Rust might be better.
- **Team Unfamiliar with TypeScript**: If your developers are more comfortable with plain JavaScript or simpler frameworks like Express.js.
