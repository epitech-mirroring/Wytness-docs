# FastAPI Benchmark

## 1. Introduction
- **Objective**: Evaluate whether **FastAPI** is suitable for developing your application.
- **Context**:
  - Type of application: RESTful API, backend for a web application, microservices, etc.
  - Specific needs: performance, scalability, ease of use, integration, etc.


## 2. Advantages of FastAPI

### a. Performance
- **Benchmark**:
  - FastAPI is often ranked among the fastest Python frameworks, thanks to its use of ASGI and Starlette.
  - Compared to Flask or Django, FastAPI is up to 3-5 times faster for I/O-intensive tasks.

- **For your application**:
  - Ideal if your API requires fast and efficient handling of asynchronous requests (e.g., interacting with databases or external APIs).

### b. Built-in Interactive Documentation
- Swagger UI and ReDoc are automatically generated from your endpoint definitions, which is a huge advantage for collaborating with front-end teams or clients.

### c. Python Type Support
- **Validation and Serialization**:
  - Python types (like `int`, `str`, `List`, etc.) and Pydantic make data validation and strict data handling straightforward.
  - Saves time on manual checks.

### d. Asynchronous Programming
- Perfect for APIs leveraging asynchronous operations (`async/await`), reducing latency in high-load environments.

### e. Adoption and Community
- Though relatively new, FastAPI has an active community and detailed documentation.
- Compatible with tools like **SQLAlchemy**, **Tortoise ORM**, and services like **Redis**, **Celery**, etc.


## 3. Disadvantages of FastAPI

### a. Learning Curve
- Asynchronous programming (`async/await`) can be confusing for developers unfamiliar with it.
- Advanced concepts, like middlewares or websockets, require a solid understanding of the basics.

### b. Deployment Environment
- FastAPI relies on ASGI and often requires servers like **Uvicorn** or **Hypercorn**.
- Integrating with traditional servers (like Apache or Nginx) may require additional configuration.

### c. Relative Maturity
- Compared to Flask or Django, FastAPI is younger, which can pose challenges for very specific or complex needs (e.g., advanced database migrations).
- Fewer third-party libraries are specifically designed for FastAPI.

### d. Performance Limits of Python
- While fast for a Python framework, it’s still constrained by Python’s interpreter. If raw performance is critical, solutions like **Go**, **Rust**, or **Node.js** might be better.


## 4. Why Choose or Not Choose FastAPI?

### When FastAPI Is Ideal:
- **API-First Applications**: If your project is centered around a RESTful or OpenAPI-compliant API.
- **Modern Python Usage**: If your team is already leveraging Python type annotations.
- **Asynchronous Scalability**: For applications with high concurrency or integrations with third-party services.
- **Automated Documentation**: If you need instantly ready API documentation.

### When FastAPI Is Not Ideal:
- **Complex Monolithic Development**: For projects requiring advanced management like what Django offers.
- **Team Not Familiar with Modern Python or Async**: If your team prefers simpler tools like Flask.
- **Raw Performance Requirements**: If response times are critical and Python is a bottleneck.
