# Comparative Study of Backend technologies

## 1. Introduction
As part of our project, we evaluated three modern API frameworks: **FastAPI** (Python), **NestJS** (TypeScript/Node.js), and **Gin** (Golang). The goal was to select the framework best suited to our requirements in terms of:

- **Performance**
- **Ease of development**
- **Scalability**
- **Ecosystem and tools**
- **Learning curve**

### Summary of the Choice
After a thorough analysis, **NestJS** was selected for its **balance between structure, performance, and advanced features**. This document provides a detailed comparison of the three frameworks and explains our choice.

| **Learning curve**      | Low               | Moderate             | Moderate to high     |


### 2.2 Strengths and Weaknesses of Each Framework

#### **FastAPI**
- **Strengths**:
  - Simplicity due to Python.
  - Built-in interactive documentation (Swagger/Redoc).
  - Very good performance for asynchronous APIs.

- **Weaknesses**:
  - Less structured for large projects (no native modular architecture).
  - Less suited for applications needing microservices or advanced tools like GraphQL.

#### **NestJS**
- **Strengths**:
  - Modular architecture inspired by Angular, facilitating organization of complex projects.
  - Rich tools and native integrations (microservices support, GraphQL, WebSockets, etc.).
  - Good balance between simplicity and structure, with clear documentation.
  - TypeScript language providing safety, autocomplete, and strong type checking.

- **Weaknesses**:
  - Slightly steeper learning curve than FastAPI (due to TypeScript and modular structure) but still lower than Gin.
  - Performance slightly lower than Gin in scenarios with very high loads.

#### **Gin**
- **Strengths**:
  - Exceptional performance thanks to Go.
  - Minimalist framework, ideal for simple and fast RESTful APIs.
  - Native goroutine management for efficient concurrent processing.
  - Higher learning curve for teams unfamiliar with Go.

- **Weaknesses**:
  - Lacks built-in tools like an ORM or interactive documentation.
  - Requires more effort to implement advanced features (GraphQL, authentication, etc.).


## 3. Justification for Choosing NestJS

### 3.1 Performance
- While Gin offers the best raw performance, **NestJS is performant enough for our needs** thanks to its efficient use of Node.js.
- FastAPI is also performant but slightly lags behind NestJS in complex scenarios requiring native microservices or GraphQL support.

### 3.2 Ease of Development
- **NestJS** provides a good compromise between structure and flexibility thanks to its modular architecture.
- Its built-in tools (CLI, validation, middleware, error handling) enable rapid and robust development.
- FastAPI is simpler to use initially, but its lack of a native modular organization can complicate maintenance for large-scale projects.

### 3.3 Ecosystem and Tools
- NestJS stands out for its native integrations:
  - Effortless GraphQL support.
  - Compatibility with microservices and cloud-native tools.
  - WebSockets and advanced middleware management.
- FastAPI offers efficient tools, but Gin requires more third-party libraries to fill gaps, increasing setup time.

### 3.4 Scalability
- The modular architecture of NestJS naturally supports scalability.
- Gin is very suitable for microservices but its minimalism requires more manual effort to coordinate complex projects.
- FastAPI is scalable, but its less structured model complicates management of very large projects.

### 3.5 Learning Curve
- **TypeScript**, while slightly more complex than Python, improves maintainability through strict typing.
- NestJS enforces discipline via its structure, which can slow initial adoption but ensures better long-term productivity.


## 4. Conclusion

### Why NestJS?
- **Modular structure**: Simplifies management of complex projects.
- **Comprehensive ecosystem**: Tools and integrations tailored to our needs (GraphQL, microservices, WebSockets).
- **Sufficient performance**: While Gin is faster, NestJS is performant enough for our application.
- **TypeScript language**: Offers an excellent balance of simplicity and safety through strong typing.

### Accepted Limitations
- A steeper learning curve compared to FastAPI.
- Slightly lower performance than Gin, though not critical in our context.

### Final Decision
**NestJS was chosen as the primary framework for our project, offering the optimal balance of structure, performance, and integrated tools to meet our current and future needs.**
