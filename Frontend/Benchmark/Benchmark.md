# Comparing frameworks: Nuxt, Angular and React

This document compares three popular web frameworks: **Nuxt**, **Angular**, and **React**. Each framework offers specific advantages in terms of performance, ecosystem, ease of learning, development, maintenance, and use cases. This detailed analysis will help you choose the framework best suited to your needs.

## Performance

#### Summary

| Criteria | Nuxt | Angular | React |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Initial Load** | Fast thanks to SSR and SSG | Heavier because of the full ecosystem | Very fast, depends on configuration (CSR/SSR via Next.js) | Optimised performance with Vue 3 and Vue 3.
| **Runtime** | Optimised with Vue 3 and reactivity | Consistent performance but can be verbose | Very fast thanks to Virtual DOM | SSR and SSG
| **Rendering** | SSR/SSG integrated | Main CSR, SSR via Universal | Native CSR, SSR via Next.js |

#### Details

Nuxt stands out for its integrated **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and **Static Site Generation (SSG)** capabilities, making it particularly suited to applications that require fast load times and SEO optimisation.

Angular, while powerful, can have slower initial load times due to its comprehensive ecosystem and the size of its bundles. However, its **Ahead-of-Time (AOT)** compilation system improves runtime performance.

React, in combination with **Next.js** for SSR, offers competitive performance, particularly in terms of **Time to Interactive (TTI)** and **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**. Its flexible architecture means that performance can be optimised to meet specific needs.

## Ecosystem

#### Summary

| Criteria | Nuxt | Angular | React |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **State Management** | Vuex, Pinia | NgRx, Akita | Redux, Zustand |
| **Routing** | Integrated | Integrated |External (React Router) |
| **Tooling** | Excellent (Nuxt CLI, vite) | Completed with Angular CLI | Basic, but extensible with Vite, Webpack |

#### Details

Nuxt stands out for its modular approach and intuitive CLI, making it easy to quickly set up projects with a coherent structure. Its integration with Vue 3 and tools such as Pinia enables modern, simplified state management.

Angular offers a complete and coherent ecosystem, with integrated routing and libraries like Angular Material for the UI. However, its complexity can be a challenge for small projects.

React, while more modular and requiring external libraries (such as Redux or React Router), remains a popular choice thanks to its flexibility and rich community ecosystem.

## Ease of learning

#### Summary

| Criteria | Nuxt | Angular | React |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Learning curve** | Gentle due to Vue | Abrupt due to complexity | Medium, with simple but extensible concepts |
**Documentation** | Excellent and clear | Comprehensive but dense | Accessible, with lots of community content | Accessible, with lots of community content | Accessible, with lots of community content | Accessible, with lots of community content | Accessible, with lots of community content

#### Details

Nuxt (and Vue) is often recommended for beginners thanks to its intuitive syntax and well-organised documentation. Angular, on the other hand, requires a thorough prior understanding of concepts such as services, modules and strong typing with TypeScript. React, with its concepts such as functional components and hooks, is considered to be a happy medium.

## Development and Maintenance

#### Summary

| Criteria | Nuxt | Angular | React |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Modularity** | High thanks to Vue 3 | Medium, highly structured | Very high |
| **Maintenance** | Simple, minimal configuration | Demanding for large projects | Medium, depends on third-party dependencies |

#### Details

Nuxt simplifies development thanks to its strong conventions and minimal configuration. Angular imposes a rigid architecture, which makes complex projects easier to maintain, but can slow down development cycles. React, with its modularity, is better suited to scalable projects, but can become difficult to maintain if dependencies are poorly managed.

## Use cases

#### Summary

| Project Type | Nuxt | Angular | React |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **SEO / Static Sites** | Ideal (native SSR/SSG) | Possible (via Universal) | Very good with Next.js |
| **Business Applications** | Moderately suitable | Ideal | Suitable (modular) |
| **Dynamic applications** | Very good | Good | Ideal |

#### Details

- **Nuxt** is ideal for sites requiring strong SEO optimisation or static generation, such as blogs or showcase sites.
- **Angular** is ideal for large enterprise applications requiring strict structure and strong typing.
- **React** is a flexible choice for dynamic projects such as marketplaces or social networks.

## Personal opinion

We tested all three frameworks via PoC and found **Nuxt** to be the most suitable for our project due to its ease of use, performance and the needs of our application. **Angular** was too complex for our team and **React** was a good choice, but **Nuxt** offered better integration with Vue 3.


## Conclusion

The choice between the different technologies to be tested will depend mainly on the needs of our project. The skills and appetite of our team members. In terms of affinity with the technologies, the team chose Nuxt for its ease of use and performance. From the point of view of our project, Nuxt is the most suitable framework for our application, Angular is better suited to larger applications and React offers great flexibility, but requires more configuration and manual management, which makes it less suitable for our current needs.
